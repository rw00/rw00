### About Me

I'm Raf and I have been a Software Engineer for 10 years now. \
My experience ranges from technical services and in-house software development in Java \
to customer-facing microservices design and implementation in Kotlin, Go and more...

I studied Computer Science in university, and I have shared some of those projects here on GitHub.
